## 5.1 GitHub Projects

**GitHub Projects** is a flexible project management tool for planning and tracking work directly on GitHub.

### Views Available
| View | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Board** | Kanban-style columns (To do, In Progress, Done) | Visualising workflow |
| **Table** | Spreadsheet-like rows and columns | Bulk editing, sorting |
| **Roadmap** | Timeline/Gantt view | Planning releases and sprints |

### Key Features
- **Items** — issues, PRs, or draft notes can be added to a project
- **Custom fields** — Status, Priority, Sprint, Estimate, Date, etc.
- **Workflows** — automate status updates (e.g., auto-move to "Done" when issue closes)
- **Insights** — charts and burn-up/burn-down reports
- **Filters and grouping** — slice data by any field

### Project Automation
- Auto-add items: when an issue is opened in a linked repo
- Auto-archive: when item is closed
- Auto-set status: based on PR or issue state changes

---

## 5.2 Milestones

- Group issues and PRs targeting a **specific goal or release version**
- Shows **progress percentage** (open vs closed items)
- Has an optional **due date** for tracking deadlines
- Example: `v2.0.0`, `Q1 2026`, `Sprint 5`

---

## 5.3 Labels

- Coloured tags applied to issues and PRs for **categorisation and filtering**
- Default labels: `bug`, `documentation`, `duplicate`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `invalid`, `question`, `wontfix`
- Custom labels can be created per repository

> ⭐ **Exam Tip:** `good first issue` and `help wanted` are the standard labels used to attract open-source contributors to beginner-friendly tasks.
